## [2026-07-04] docs | Rulebook drift sweep (batched sync, pods, deps)

Rules + CLAUDE.md reconciled with shipped code after a full review of
`.claude/rules/` + `CLAUDE.md`. Fixed stale facts: background-sync.md's
fictional "500ms debounce before push" replaced with the real batched-push
contract (pushPendingBatched chunks, poison-row fallback, telemetry-only
`PushStats.pushed`); performance.md's two-arg `AppLogger('perf', ...)`
examples corrected to the single-message contract (mirrored in
[[patterns/performance]]); data-layer.md remote-source count 26→27;
data-io.md documents the all-or-nothing `saveAll` Excel import; premium
entitlement flow notes the 5-min `ResumeThrottle`. Added missing content:
notifications.md § FCM deferred-off-splash guard, observability.md
`sentryTracesSampleRateFor` enforcement note, calendar.md single-pass
filter rule, CLAUDE.md key-dep corrections (supabase iOS-CI cap,
purchases 10.2.3) + pod-install build command + an "Adding or bumping a
dependency" workflow. Oldest two log entries rotated to the new
[[log-archive-2026-07-d]].
